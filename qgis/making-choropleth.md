# Making a choropleth in QGIS

[This is a good tutorial](https://sites.temple.edu/tudsc/2018/11/26/simple-methods-for-advanced-maps-in-qgis/) from Temple U. The core thing was finding the graduated fill style:

> Under the Symbology option in the Layer Properties menu the type can now be set as Graduated, and the data to be shown selected as “EU-referendum-result-data_Pct_Remain.” A bright and clear color should be selected – in this case red – and the number of classes can be set to three.1 In this case the best algorithm to use for rendering is Quantile.2 This completes the first choropleth map.

[This tutorial](http://maps.unomaha.edu/Peterson/CartaDesign/QGIS1/QGIS_Instructions1.htm) was useful, too.
